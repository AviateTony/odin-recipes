<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The great thing about the internet is that there are loads of options for any recipe your heart desires.The bad thing
    about the internet is sifting through all those Google search results to find a recipe that actually works as
    promised and is exactly what you are after.</p>

<p>So here is what I promise you: If you love perfectly seasoned crispy buffalo wings, tossed in a classic spicy,
    buttery Buffalo Sauce with a tinge of sweetness, and you prefer to avoid the mess and calories of deep frying, this
    is <strong>The One</strong>.</p>

<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Chicken Drumsticks</li>
    <li>Baking Powder</li>
    <li>Franks Red Hot Buffalo Sauce</li>
</ul>

<h4>Steps</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Pat dry the chicken drumsticks and place into a large mixing bowl.</li>
    <li>Apply generous amount of baking powder to the drumsticks, as this will help with making the chicken wings extra
        crispy!</li>
    <li>Next, we'll add half the bottle of the Franks Red Hot Buffalo Sauce, which will bake the buffalo sauce into the
        chicken and add to the flavor.</li>
    <li>We will then place the drumsticks on a baking sheet and in the oven on the bottom rack at 250 degrees for 30
        minutes.</li>
    <li>Once the timer is up, we'll place the drumsticks on the top rack and bake for an additional 45 minutes at 425
        degrees.</li>
    <li>Once the final baking session is complete, we'll remove the wings from the oven and toss them in the last half
        of the buffalo sauce we used earlier.</li>
    <li>Finally, we'll serve them up and enjoy!</li>
