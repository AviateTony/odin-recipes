<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This recipe for firecracker chicken meatballs has been stuck in my head on an endless loop for the last several
    weeks. I had been craving something with a little more spice, yet a little sweet too. And what’s more perfect than
    game day food that’s actually somewhat healthy (they’re baked!) and still has tons of flavor but isn’t your regular
    old meatball covered in marinara?</p>
